# GitMetrics

This is a simple Git Metrics Ruby program designed to work with a text file of a git log and return three things:
The number of commits in the log, the number of developers based on the number of emails contributing the to the 
git log, and the numbers of days that the project has been or was in development based on the first and last commit 
of the log.
